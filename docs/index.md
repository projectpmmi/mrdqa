# What is the Malaria Routine Data Quality Assessment (MRDQA) application?

The MRDQA application is a digital implementation of the MEASURE Malaria Routine Data Quality Assessment Tool (M-RDQA) wich is adapted from WHO/MEASURE Evaluation (ME) Data Quality Review Tool (DQR) supervision checklist. A component of the WHO/CDC/Gates Foundation Malaria Surveillance Assessment tool targeting data quality checks below the district level.

The MRDQA application is an adaptation to Android devices to facilitate use and aggregation of data to subnational and national levels. The application is composed of a DHIS2 metadata package and a mobile client application.
