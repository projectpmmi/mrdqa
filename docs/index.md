# What is the Malaria Routine Data Quality Assessment (MRDQA) application?

The MRDQA is an android app used to facilitate data collection of information on data quality for routine malaria reporting from health facilities. The app employs internationally standardized metrics to evaluate the completeness, timeliness, accuracy, and consistency of routine data for malaria. The app is intended to be used as part of routine supervision by district health teams or malaria program managers. The app is accompanied by a “DHIS 2 Configuration Package” which includes meta data and dashboards to permit the uploading of results from supervisory visits to the national instance of DHIS 2 where it can be aggregated with results from other supervisory visits for the same purpose in the country. The aggregate data on data quality for malaria can be evaluated by sub-national unit and over time to permit a more centralized and standard approach to data quality monitoring and response. The app is open source and can be easily adapted to other health and disease programs.

The MRDQA application is a digital implementation of the MEASURE Malaria Routine Data Quality Assessment Tool (M-RDQA) which is adapted from WHO/MEASURE Evaluation (ME) Data Quality Review Tool (DQR) supervision checklist. A component of the WHO/CDC/Gates Foundation Malaria Surveillance Assessment tool targeting data quality checks below the district level.
